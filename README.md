So, I'm here to bring some [light] fun in you [life] browser. 

Install it and have fun :)

_Sadly, I am too greedy to pay $5 to Google, so in order to install it you have to enable developer mode and load it unpacked in chrome://extensions. Sorry for that._

This extension is in testing phase, so some bugs may appear and **_must_** be **_reported_**!
